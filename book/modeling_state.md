# Modeling state

- Use authentication as example
- Show a typical setup
- Point out the implicit state, that should be explicit
- Show how to model it differently
- Does not matter what framework or state management solution, this is fundamentally a better way
  - Compare how many states the simple example could have
  - Compared to the explicit one
