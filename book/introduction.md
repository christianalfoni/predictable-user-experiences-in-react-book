# Introduction

Learning programming is hard, it is much harder than learning a programming language. Programming languages are about syntax, memory management and instructing the computer. Programming is about abstractions, patterns and communicating intent with the vocabulary of the programming language. In other words programming is an abstract concept that requires you to go way beyond the variables and keywords on your screen.

Even though this book focuses on application architecture in [React](https://reactjs.org/), the key take away is the abstractions, patterns and how we communicate our intent. It can be applied to other languages and frameworks as well. There are also many challenges to be solved within an application architecture, but the ultimate quest is to create a predictable user experience and this has surprisingly little to do with the language and framework you choose. It just happens that some languages and frameworks helps you more than others.

A **predictable user experiences** is not about good or bad user experiences. You have to read other books to learn more about that. Predictability refers to whatever user experience you design, it actually works as intended. But not only that, predictability also refers to the abstractions and patterns revealing flaws in that design. Cause this happens all the time. We over simplify the complexity of user flows. We tend to forget and even ignore possible errors. And our natural instinct to write [DRY code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) hides the communication of intent to other developers.

I am a visual learner and will use a lot of visual tools to help you reflect on the concepts introduced in this book. In the first part of the book we will discuss mental models, where I will lean on a lot of visualisation. In the second part we will apply them to an actual implementation where you will see a lot more code. If you prefer building your own mental model looking at code, please skip to that part and then read the mental model section last to align your thoughts.

The book uses [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), but you do not have to understand TypeScript to understand the concepts in this book. Actually, you might finally understand what the fuss is all about as we will use TypeScript

I hope to give you an experience where you can consume the contents of this book without writing code. It is not about learning a framework and using opinionated APIs. It is about understanding a mindset of creating predictable user experiences.

I hope you will enjoy it :-)
